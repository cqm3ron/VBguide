# Visual Basic Guide
## A GCSE Visual Basic Guide with many useful tips that I have picked up along the way

So, you're here because you don't know Visual Basic very well, but you want to.

Or, you're here because I got fed up of you asking me for help and sent you here. I'll let you decide which one.

I have attached links to specific chapters below, just click on any link to see more about a topic.

### Variable Iteration

To increase the value of a variable `x` by 1, you may have been taught the following: 

```
x = x + 1
```

But, instead of this, you can do:
```
x += 1
```

This works for other operations too:
```
x -= 1 'subtracts 1 from x
x *= 1 'multiplies x by 1
x /= 1 'divides x by 1
```
Of course, some of these are completely useless (such as dividing by 1), but you can replace 1 with any other value, including another variable:
```
x += y
```
